# Contributing to DSAverseX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **🌌 DSAverseX: A Community-driven Library of Algorithm and Data Structure Solutions**.
This guide will show you how to add your code, suggest improvements, and support fellow contributors.

## 💻 How You Can Contribute Code

- **Add New Solutions:** Submit original code for algorithm or data structure problems in the correct topic folder.  
- **Improve Existing Code:** Refactor for readability, efficiency, or clarity. Add helpful comments.  
- **Add Explanatory Files:** Include short Markdown explanations alongside your code when possible.  
- **Suggest Enhancements:** Open an issue if you notice ways to improve structure, naming, or organization.  
- **Optimize Solutions:** Provide faster or more memory-efficient implementations.  
- **Add Multi-Language Versions:** Submit solutions in other programming languages.  
- **Write Test Cases:** Include input/output examples or unit tests.  
- **Fix Bugs:** Correct errors or inconsistencies in existing code.

## 📐 Guidelines for Code Contributions

- **Organize by Language:** Place your code files inside the appropriate language folder (`/cpp/`, `/python/`, `/java/`, etc.).  
- **One Problem per File:** Name each file descriptively (e.g., `binary_search.cpp`, `merge_sort.py`).  
- **Add Comments:** Briefly describe your approach and note any important edge cases directly in the code.  
- **Avoid Duplicates:** If a solution already exists in your language folder, either improve/refactor it or add an alternative with a unique filename.  
- **Follow Style Conventions:** Use standard formatting and naming practices for your chosen language.  
- **Respect the Code of Conduct:** Keep interactions positive, constructive, and collaborative.
